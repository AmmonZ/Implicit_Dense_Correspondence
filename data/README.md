### Dataset

- #### BHCP

- #### ShapeNet part

- #### Non-Existence Detection

  Our method can build dense correspondences for 3D shapes with different topologies, and automatically declare the non-existence of correspondence. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no benchmark providing the non-existence label between a shape pair. We thus build a dataset with 1,000 paired shapes from the chair category of ShapeNet part dataset. Within a pair, one has the arm part while the other does not. For the former, we annotate 5 arm points and 5 non-arm points based on provided part labels.  We make the dataset publicly available for research.
